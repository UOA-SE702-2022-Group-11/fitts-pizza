        A lot of interfaces use pointing as input: clicking on the screen with a
        mouse, pointing on a phone with your finger, or tapping with a pen are
        common. Since these techniques are used so often, it's good to know how
        much time they will take so that you can design interactive systems to
        be efficient. Should you have bigger buttons on a screen so they are
        easier to press? Or is it better to have lots of small ones close
        together? And how is this affected if you're in a difficult environment
        such as bouncing around in a vehicle or helping after a natural
        disaster?
      </p>
      <p>
        The amount of time it takes to point at things on a digital device is
        surprisingly predictable, and we're going to explore a common way to
        make predictions about this based on the work of the psychologist Paul
        Fitts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amount of time it takes to point at an object depends on two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the width of the object and</li>
        <li>the distance you have to move to point at it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This observation can be measured mathematically using a formula known as
        <em>Fitts' law.</em>
      </p>

      <h1>Fitts' Law</h1>
      <p>
        Fitts' law gives a formula to help us estimate how long it will take
        someone to click or tap at something on a screen. The thing that you're
        pointing at might be a button, menu, sprite, text box or something else,
        but the general word we use for it is the "target". When we write a
        formula for this, we use D for the distance to the target, and W for the
        "width" (size) of the target.

      <p>
        The units of measurement don't really matter as long they are consistent
        - it might be pixels, centimetres or inches.
      </p>
      <p>
        The heart of Fitts' law is the ratio of D/W. For example, if you need to
        move a mouse 14cm to get to a 2cm target, D is 14cm and W is 2cm, so D/W
        is 7.
      </p>
      <p>
        One simple prediction from Fitts' law predicts that if this ratio is the
        same, then the time to point at the target will be the same. For
        example, moving a distance of 7cm to get to a 1cm target also has D/W
        ratio of 7, so should take about the same amount of time as moving 14cm
        to a 2cm target.
      </p>
      <h2>Index of Difficulty (ID)</h2>
      <p>
        However, if the ratio doubles, the time does not double. For example, if
        the target size stays the same, but it is placed twice as far away, it
        won't take twice as long to move to it - the time taken goes up only a
        small amount. To work this out, Fitts introduced the "Index of
        Difficulty" (ID), which is proportional to the time it should take to
        point at a target. The formula for the Index of Difficulty (ID) is shown
        below.
      </p>
      <p>$$ ID=\log_2\Big(\frac{D}{W}+1\Big) $$</p>
      <p>
        For example, if you put in a distance of 14 and a width of 2, the index
        of difficulty is 3.0. If you wanted to make the pointing take twice as
        long, you'd need the ID to be twice as much (6.0). Try experimenting
        with the distance in the formula above to get an ID of 6.0. You'll find
        that it needs to be more than twice as big; in fact, it needs to be
        126cm - that's right, the distance needs to be a lot larger to make the
        pointing take twice as long.
      </p>
      <h2>Movement Time (MT)</h2>
      <p>
        MT is directly proportional to ID. \(a\) and \(b\) are constants MT
        intercept and slope, these are dependent on the person and the pointing
        device being used during data collection? Fitts' law predicts that the
        time taken to point at a target (Movement Time) will be proportional to
        the "Index of Difficulty". The following formula can be used to make
        these predictions.
      </p>
      <p>$$ MT=a+b\Big(\log_2\Big(\frac{D}{W}+1\Big)\Big) $$</p>
      <p>
        In this formula, \(a\) and \(b\) are constants that are dependent on the
        person, and the pointing device being used. These values can be
        empirically determined. \(a\) is the Movement Time intercept, while
        \(b\) is the slope.
      </p>
      <p>
        By timing users when interacting with an interface, the results of
        Movement Time, also known as the Average Time, can be plotted against
        Index of Difficulty to allow the calculation of \(a\) and \(b\). As seen
        in the graph below, Average Time is directly proportional to Index of
        Difficulty.
