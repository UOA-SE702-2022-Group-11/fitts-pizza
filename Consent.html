      <h2>Participant Information Sheet</h2>
      <h3>Welcome</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Group 11’s SOFTENG 702 user study. This informational sheet gives a detailed explanation of the entire 
        user study so that you have all the information you need to consider offering your consent to participate in this 
        study. You may withdraw yourself from the study at any point. Researchers conducting the study will not exert any 
        pressure on you, the potential participant, to continue with the study in any capacity should you choose to remove 
        yourself from the study.
      </p>
      <h3>Study Outline</h3>
      <p>
        This study is primarily focused on evaluating the effectiveness of interactive teaching methods in helping student’s 
        fortify their knowledge of the user interaction design principle, Fitts’ Law. This study consists of three main 
        sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, the research participant will be asked to complete some pre-readings about Fitts’ Law. This will help the 
        participant to become acquainted with the core concepts that will be explored throughout the study. Next, the 
        participant will be asked to complete a pre-activity evaluation assessing their understanding and attitudes of Fitts’ 
        Law. This pre-activity evaluation is only meant to provide the researchers with an indication of the participant’s 
        background knowledge of the concepts under study.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second section involves one of two activities which the participant will be assigned to:
      </p>
      <p>
        One activity asks the participant to interact with an online tool where they will be tasked with completing tasks using 
        various designed interfaces. During this phase of the study, researchers conducting the study will not be able to answer 
        any questions regarding the actual task nor provide any hints to help the user progress through the task faster. This is 
        so that the user study is fair and equitable across participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another activity asks the participant to interact with an online tool where they will be tasked with performing a task 
        using the tool provided. During this phase of the study, researchers conducting the study will not be able to answer any 
        questions regarding the actual task nor provide any hints to help the user progress through the task faster. This is so 
        that the user study is fair and equitable across participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the last section of the study consists of post-activity evaluation questions. Participants will be asked to 
        compare and contrast different designs and provide reasoning for their conclusions. Participants will also rank a set of 
        designs. Additionally, the participants will be asked to complete a small multi-choice quiz. Participants will also be 
        evaluated on their attitudes towards Fitts’ Law.
